Note there are two RapidBlock examples-

PicoScope6000ExampleRapidBlockBulkOverlapped.vi
-Calls ps6000GetVaulesBulk() to get all memory segments (waveforms) at once.
-Does NOT support Aggregated downsampling
-Uses ps6000SetDataBufferBulk() to set max "Max Buffer Pointers" only.

PicoScope6000ExampleRapidBlock.vi
-Calls ps6000SetDataBuffers() and ps6000GetVaules() in a loop to get all memory segments (waveforms)
-Does support Aggregated downsampling
